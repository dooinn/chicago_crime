## Introduction
This project delves into Chicago's crime data from 2008 to 2022, providing a detailed analysis of crime trends in various neighborhoods. Using SQL and Tableau, we present the findings in an easily understandable format. This is especially beneficial for Chicago residents interested in gaining insights into safety trends in their area.

## Methods and Tools

- **Data Source**: The Chicago Crimes Dataset, available [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2022/9hwr-2zxp/data), serves as the foundation of this analysis. While the full dataset starts from 2001, this project zeroes in on the period between 2008 and 2022, comprising approximately 1.1 million rows of data.
- **Tools**: Data wrangling and analysis were conducted using MySQL, and the visual representation was achieved with Tableau dashboards.

## Key Findings

- **Crime Count**: From 2008 to 2022, Chicago reported a total of 1,190,000 crime cases.
- **Most Common Crimes**: Theft and Battery emerged as the most prevalent crimes.
- **Peak Crime Times**: Rather than the early hours, midday and midnight have the highest crime rates, with the reasons varying by year, month, and location.
- **Neighborhood Safety Metrics**: "Edison Park" records the lowest crime numbers. However, "West Garfield Park" has the highest arrest rate at 36.36%, and "West Glen" has the lowest at 5.92%.
- **Crime Hotspots**: Streets, apartments, and residences are where most crimes occur. Theft is prevalent on streets around 8 PM and midnight, while apartments and residences frequently report domestic crimes like battery.

## Discussion & Conclusion
While the above insights provide a general overview, they don't encompass all neighborhoods or periods. Users are encouraged to dive deeper, potentially zeroing in on areas of personal interest. Such nuanced exploration could provide individuals with knowledge of potential safety concerns specific to their lived experiences.
